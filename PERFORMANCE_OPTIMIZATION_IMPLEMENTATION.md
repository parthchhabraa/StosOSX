### Module Registration for Cleanup

```python
# Register a module for automatic cleanup
def cleanup_callback():
    # Custom cleanup logic
    pass

perf_manager.cleanup_manager.register_module(
    "my_module", module_instance, cleanup_callback
)

# Update module usage
perf_manager.update_module_usage("my_module", memory_mb=50.0, cpu_percent=10.0)
```

```python
from core.graphics_optimizer import GraphicsOptimizer

graphics_opt = GraphicsOptimizer(logger)
graphics_opt.initialize()

# Apply Raspberry Pi optimizations
graphics_opt.optimize_for_raspberry_pi()

# Create optimized animation
animation = graphics_opt.create_optimized_animation(widget, opacity=0.5)
