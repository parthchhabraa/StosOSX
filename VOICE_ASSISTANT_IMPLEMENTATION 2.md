# Voice Assistant Implementation Summary

## Task 11: Develop Voice Assistant Foundation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Requirements:** 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive voice assistant foundation for StosOS that provides hands-free interaction capabilities through speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech functionality.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Voice Assistant Module (`modules/voice_assistant.py`)

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Speech recognition using SpeechRecognition library
- ✅ Text-to-speech functionality with pyttsx3 for human-like responses  
- ✅ Wake word "stos" detection for hands-free activation
- ✅ Voice command parser and routing system to appropriate modules
- ✅ Voice feedback and confirmation for executed commands

**Key Components:**
- `VoiceAssistantModule`: Main module class inheriting from BaseModule
- Wake word detection with background threading
- Command listening and processing pipeline
- Module registration system for voice command routing
- Built-in command handling (time, date, status, help)
- UI components with status indicators and controls

### 2. Voice Service Layer (`services/voice_service.py`)

**Features:**
- Low-level voice processing capabilities
- Advanced wake word detection with pattern matching
- Speech recognition optimization and configuration
- Audio preprocessing and noise reduction support
- Voice activity detection framework
- Statistics tracking and performance monitoring

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize()`: Setup speech recognition and TTS engines
- `listen_for_wake_word()`: Detect wake word patterns
- `listen_for_command()`: Capture voice commands
- `speak()`: Convert text to speech with threading
- `calibrate_microphone()`: Adjust for ambient noise

### 3. Voice Command Parser (`core/voice_command_parser.py`)

**Features:**
- Natural language processing for voice commands
- Intent recognition with confidence scoring
- Parameter extraction from commands
- Module routing based on command content
- Context awareness and conversation tracking
- Time and number extraction utilities

**Supported Command Types:**
- Task management: "Create a task", "Show my tasks", "Complete task"
- Calendar: "Schedule meeting", "Show calendar", "What's my schedule"
- Smart home: "Turn on lights", "Set temperature to 72"
- Music: "Play music", "Pause music", "Skip song"
- Study: "Start study session", "Begin pomodoro"
- Ideas: "Save this idea", "Remember this"
- System: "What time is it", "Help", "Status"

### 4. Integration Architecture

**Module Registration System:**
```python
voice_assistant.register_module("task_manager", task_module)
voice_assistant.register_module("calendar", calendar_module)
voice_assistant.register_module("smart_home", smart_home_module)
```

**Command Routing Flow:**
1. Wake word detection activates assistant
2. Speech recognition captures command
3. Voice command parser analyzes intent and extracts parameters
4. Command router directs to appropriate module
5. Module processes command and returns result
6. Voice feedback confirms action completion

def handle_voice_command(self, command: str) -> bool:
    if "create task" in command.lower():
        # Process task creation
        return True
    return False
```
