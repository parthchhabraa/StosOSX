## Integration with StosOS

The TaskManager module is designed to integrate seamlessly with the main StosOS application:

1. **Module Registration**: Inherits from BaseModule for consistent interface
2. **Screen Management**: Provides Kivy Screen for navigation
3. **Database Integration**: Uses existing DatabaseManager
4. **Theme Consistency**: Uses StosOS theme and components
5. **Voice Integration**: Handles voice commands through standard interface
6. **Error Handling**: Follows StosOS error handling patterns

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:
- Calendar integration for unified timeline view
- Task templates and recurring tasks
- Collaboration features for shared tasks
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with study tracker for time logging
- Export/import functionality for task data

## Demo Usage

A console-based demo is available to test the functionality:

```bash
cd stosos
python3 demo_task_manager.py
```

This provides a full interactive demonstration of all task management features without requiring the full UI framework.

## Conclusion

The Task Manager module successfully implements all required functionality for comprehensive task management in StosOS. It provides a robust, user-friendly interface for managing study tasks and assignments, with full integration into the StosOS ecosystem and support for voice commands and deadline notifications.
